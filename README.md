Merges the training (subject_train, X_train, y_train) and the test sets (subject_test, X_test, y_test) to create one data set.


Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. (grep those column names with mean or std)

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (use activity label data)

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. (use features data)

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.(use aggregate)
